The FAQ section provides clear and concise answers to common user queries, enhancing the user experience and reducing support burden.

*Form Page with Formik and Yup:*
The form page utilizes Formik for form management and Yup for data validation. This ensures accurate data input and reduces user errors.

*Responsive Design with Material UI:*
Material UI is used for the design and structure of the user interface, ensuring a responsive and modern layout. Material UI components provide a consistent and aesthetically pleasing user experience.

*Developed with React and TypeScript:*
